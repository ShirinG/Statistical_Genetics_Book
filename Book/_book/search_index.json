These resources will mainly be papers, because as opposed to books, students usually have access to them via their institution and wouldn’t need to spend additional money. For core concepts, that are central to understanding and evaluating the analysis, I explain them in more detail comprehensive book covering concepts and modern statistical tools for estimation and analysis, with tons of examples, and homework focus the majority of the book on providing multiple case studies from these topics (e.g. in each chapter, provide a complete data analysis starting from the preprocessing the data, exploratory data analysis, applying models / inference, summarizing the results) providing greater context of a data analysis: frame each chapter as a complete data analysis of one or two datasets, demonstrating how the R functions can be used in various stages of the data analysis keep the simple example case studies for the chapters and include exercises for using more complicated datasets provide solutions or hints if there is no unique answers The most common mistake with exercises is not including enough easy ones; it is discouraging to get stuck on the first one create a corresponding GitHub repository to provide online exercises hands on exercises with solutions, data downloadable Structure of the book Software information and conventions All analyses are run on R version 3.3.3 (2017-03-06) – “Another Canoe”. Some packages are available via CRAN, while others are hosted at Bioconductor. I will provide package installation instructions at the beginning of each example, indicating where each package can be found. I will also be using the library() function, rather than require() for loading packages to make sure that there will be an error message in case packages have not been installed correctly. The example workflows included are meant to illustrate the theoretical concepts and get you started on your own analysis. They are minimal examples of the necessary steps but are not meant to substitute the package manuals. When you want to apply the workflows to your own data, I highly recommend going back to the package documentation to find out about additional functions and using the help() function to explore parameter options. I will be using the same naming and code schemes as in the package manuals to make finding the relevant parts easy. Acknowledgments "]
