Some packages are available via CRAN, while others are hosted at Bioconductor. I will provide package installation instructions at the beginning of each example, indicating where each package can be found. I will also be using the library() function, rather than require() for loading packages to make sure that we will get an error message in case packages have not been installed correctly. The example workflows included are meant to illustrate the theoretical concepts and get you started on your own analysis. They are minimal examples of the necessary steps but are not meant to substitute the package manuals. When you want to apply the workflows to your own data, I highly recommend going back to the package documentation to find out about additional functions and using the help() function to explore parameter options. I will be using the same naming and code schemes as in the package manuals to make finding the relevant parts easy. Acknowledgments "]
