	abstract = {Molecular marker loci were used to investigate the inheritance of morphological traits that distinguish maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) from a closely related wild relative, teosinte (Z. mays ssp. mexicana). Regression and interval mapping analyses gave largely congruent results concerning the numbers of loci controlling the morphological traits and the magnitudes of their effects; however, interval mapping tended to give larger estimates for the magnitudes of the effects of the morphological trait loci. This tendency was exaggerated for traits that were non-normally distributed. Variation for most inflorescence traits is controlled by one or two regions of the genome with large effects plus several other regions with relatively small effects. As such, the data are congruent with a mode of inheritance for most traits involving one or two major loci plus several minor loci. Regions of the genome with large effects on one trait consistently had smaller effects on several other traits, possibly as a result of pleiotropy. Most of the variation for the dramatic differences in inflorescence morphology between maize and teosinte is explained by five restricted regions of the genome. One of these regions encompasses a previously described gene, tb1 (teosinte branched), and the effects of this region on inflorescence architecture are similar to the known effects of tb1. Implications of this work for the genetic basis of morphological evolution in plants are discussed.},

abstract = "To investigate the genetic control of salt-induced hypertension, we performed a quantitative trait locus analysis on male mice from a reciprocal backcross between the salt-sensitive C57BL/6J and the normotensive A/J inbred mouse strains after they were provided with water containing 1% salt for 2 weeks. Genome-wide scans performed on these mice and analyzed with a combination of conventional marker-based regressions and a novel simultaneous search for pairs revealed six significant quantitative trait loci associated with salt-induced blood pressure, two of which were interacting loci. These six loci, named Bpq1â€“6 for blood pressure quantitative trait loci, mapped to D1Mit334, D1Mit14, D4Mit164, D5Mit31, D6Mit15, and D15Mit13. Furthermore, five of these six loci were concordant with hypertension loci in rats, and four were concordant with hypertension loci in humans, suggesting that quantitative trait loci mapping in model organisms can be used to guide the search for human blood pressure genes.

abstract = "Construction of dense genetic linkage maps is hampered, in practice, by the occurrence of laboratory typing errors. Even relatively low error rates cause substantial map expansion and interfere with the determination of correct genetic order. Here, we describe a systematic method for overcoming these difficulties, based on incorporating the possibility of error into the usual likelihood model for linkage analysis. Using this approach, it is possible to construct genetic maps allowing for error and to identify the typings most likely to be in error. The method has been implemented for \{F2\} intercrosses between two inbred strains, a situation relevant to the construction of genetic maps in experimental organisms. Tests involving both simulated and real data are presented, showing that the method detects the vast majority of errors. "

abstract ={Human genetic linkage maps are most accurately constructed by using information from many loci simultaneously. Traditional methods for such multilocus linkage analysis are computationally prohibitive in general, even with supercomputers. The problem has acquired practical importance because of the current international collaboration aimed at constructing a complete human linkage map of DNA markers through the study of three-generation pedigrees. We describe here several alternative algorithms for constructing human linkage maps given a specified gene order. One method allows maximum-likelihood multilocus linkage maps for dozens of DNA markers in such three-generation pedigrees to be constructed in minutes.},
