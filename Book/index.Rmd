# Preface {-}

This book is supposed to give an introduction to different methods used in Statistical Genetics and how to run them in the R universe. Statistical Genetics benefits a lot from the increase in computing power and data storage possibilities, because it allows us to run more complex models and include vastly more information into our analyses.

## Why read this book {-}

This book will follow a hands-on approach, including code chunks and exercises for each chapter. This makes it useful for using as a compendium to Statistical Genetics courses for students and for everybody looking to get into Statistical Genetics analyses in R.

## Structure of the book {-}

Chapter \@ref(introduction-to-statistical-genetics) introduces Statistical Genetics.



## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.
