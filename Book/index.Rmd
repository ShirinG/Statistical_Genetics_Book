# Index

This book is supposed to be a guide to doing statistical genetics analyses with R. 

It will show full working examples using established methods and packages. Around these examples, extensive explanations will be given to aid getting a good understanding of the concepts and theories.

The focus of this book will be on conveying concepts and theories behind quantitative, population and epidemiological genetics, while providing easy-to-reproduce example workflows. I will therefore omit the use of formulas wherever possible, to primarily address users without mathematical background.
